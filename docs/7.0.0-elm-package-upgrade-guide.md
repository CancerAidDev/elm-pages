# 7.0.0 Elm package upgrade guide

Please ensure that you're on the latest elm-pages version of both the Elm package _and_ the NPM package before following these steps.

There are two new beta features, which you can opt into by running a different build command (see 2) or calling a new generated function (see 3).

There are 3 broad areas of change in this release.

1. Breaking API changes
2. Beta build command
3. Beta Template Modules feature

You can ignore (2) and (3) if you aren't interested in beta features. And even if you do choose to try these beta features, I recommend starting with (1) and getting things compiling without using any beta features first.

## 1 - Breaking API changes

### Manifest.Config now has `icons`

- The `icons` field in the manifest config will only be used for the beta, no-webpack build (see section 2). If you aren't using it, you can simply pass in an empty list for icons. The new field in the Manifest.Config has this type `icons : List.List (Pages.Manifest.Icon pathKey)`.
- `Program model msg metadata view` changed to `Program model msg metadata view pathKey`. That means there is a new type variable in `Pages.Platform.Program`. You can fix this by adding `Pages.PathKey` (a type defined in the generated Pages.elm module) as the last type variable wherever you had an annotation using the `Pages.Platform.Program` type.

                  Maybe
                      (
                      { path : PagePath pathKey
                      , query : Maybe String
                      , fragment : Maybe String
                      }
                      -> msg
                      )
            , onPageChange :
                  Maybe.Maybe
                      (
                      { path : Pages.PagePath.PagePath pathKey
                      , query : Maybe.Maybe String.String
                      , fragment : Maybe.Maybe String.String
                      , metadata : metadata
                      }
                      -> msg
                      )


            { init :
                  Maybe
                      { path : PagePath pathKey
                      , query : Maybe String
                      , fragment : Maybe String
                      }
                  -> ( model, Cmd msg )

            { init :
                  Maybe.Maybe
                      { path :
                            { path : Pages.PagePath.PagePath pathKey
                            , query : Maybe.Maybe String.String
                            , fragment : Maybe.Maybe String.String
                            }
                      , metadata : metadata
                      }
                  -> ( model, Platform.Cmd.Cmd msg )







            , subscriptions : model -> Sub msg

            , subscriptions :
                  metadata
                  -> Pages.PagePath.PagePath pathKey
                  -> model
                  -> Platform.Sub.Sub msg

## 2 - Beta build command

            -> Pages.ImagePath.ImagePath pathKey
            -> Head.Tag pathKey
        icon :
            List.List ( Basics.Int, Basics.Int )
            -> MimeType.MimeImage
