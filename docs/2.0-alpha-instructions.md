# Alpha Instructions

## What to expect

The API is not yet stable, and there will be breaking changes between now and the public 2.0 release.

There may be some remaining bugs, but overall the current alpha appears to be relatively stable.

There isn't a lot of documentation beyond the examples folder and this document right now. Part of the alpha process will be
getting the documentation ready, and changing APIs wherever things appear to be confusing or have API improvement opportunities.

Feedback and documentation improvements are very welcome.

### Special files

- `Document.elm` - defines the types for your applications view. Can expose any type called `Document msg` (must have exactly one type variable)
- `Shared.elm` must expose
  - `template : SharedTemplate Msg Model StaticData msg`
  - `Msg`
  - `Model`
  - `SharedMsg` (todo - this needs to be documented better. Consider whether there could be an easier way to wire this in for users, too)
- `Site.elm` - must expose
  - `config : SiteConfig StaticData`
- `static/index.js` - same as previous `beta-index.js`
- `static/style.css` - same as previous `beta-style.css`

## Available generated code

- `Route.elm` - lets you refer to a Route, and turn it into a path
  - Every variant in `Route` has a record of `RouteParams`, which match the `type alias RouteParams = { ... }` in the corresponding Page Template
  - Each Route has RouteParams - some of them empty, some of them non-empty - each param is a `String`, and the field key for each param corresponds to a dynamic segment (ending in `_`) in the Page Template's module name. For example, `Template.Slide.Number_` has a single route param, so it has `type alias RouteParams = { number : String }`
  - You can link or navigate to a Route programatically with `firstSlide = Route.Slide__Number_ { number = "1" }`
  - You can turn it to a String with `"/" + (Route.routeToPath firstSlide |> String.join "/")`

### Commands

- Run a dev server - `node ../../generator/src/dev-server.js`
- Generate scaffolding for a new Page Template - `../../generator/src/codegen-template-module.js Slide.Number_`
- Run a build - `node ../../generator/src/cli.js`
