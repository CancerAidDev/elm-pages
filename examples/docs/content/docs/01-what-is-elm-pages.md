# What is elm-pages

- Pre-render routes to HTML
- Hydrate to a full Elm app, with client-side navigation after initial load
- A file-based router
- `DataSource`s allow you to pull data in to a given page and have it available before load
- A nice type-safe API for SEO
- Generate files, like RSS, sitemaps, podcast feeds, or any other strings you can output with pure Elm
